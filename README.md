# Solar-System-Animation
An animation of the solar system using Processing 3

Inspired by Dan Shiffman of The Coding Train and tasked with an astronomy project to make an animation relevant to course material, I wanted to delve into the world of the Processing programming language by making an animation of the Solar System. All of the celestial bodies are to scale relative to each other, the distances between them are to scale as well, and the orbital speeds are accurate relative to one another.

The goal of this project was to combine my major (Computer Science) and my interest in programming with the content of my astronomy class. While the animation itself is fairly simple, all of the size scales of the model can be changed in the code as well as the speed of the orbits. A further application of this could be to embed the animation in a webpage with sliders/inputs for the different variables, which would allow for the tool to then be used in a more educational and hands on setting.

I hope you enjoy.
