# Solar-System-Animation
An animation of the solar system using Processing 3

Inspired by Dan Shiffman of The Coding Train and tasked with an astronomy project to make an animation relevant to course material, I wanted to delve into the world of Processing by making an animation of the Solar System. All of the celestial bodies are to scale relative to each other and the distances between them are to scale as well.

I hope you enjoy.
